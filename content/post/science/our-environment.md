## 1. Ecosystems
An _ecosystem_ is a complex system which consists of all the living organisms and the non-living constituents of an area.   
    
These may include:
- Biotic components, comprising living organisms
- Abiotic components, including physical factors like
  + temperature
  + rainfall
  + wind
  + soil

### 1.1 Examples of Ecosystems   
Take a pond for example. A variety of animals and plants (biotic components) can be found in and around a pond. These living beings are dependent on each other as well as the surrounding water, air and soil (abiotic components). Therefore the area in and around a pond forms an ecosystem.  
  
Other examples of ecosystems include:
- Forests
- Grasslands
- Lakes
- Large animals (including human beings)  
  
### 1.2 Producers, Consumers and Decomposers
According to the manner in which they obtain sustenance from the environment, organisms can be classified into Producers, Consumers and Decomposers.
  
#### Producers  
Producers are the living organisms that create organic "food" (like starch and sugars) from inorganic materials, like sunlight.  
All __green plants__ and certain __bacteria__ fall into this category.  
  
#### Consumers
Consumers either consume food produced by Producers or they eat other Consumers.  
All __animals__ are Consumers.  
Consumers are classified into three categories:  
- Herbivores: eat Producers (e.g. cows, sheep)  
- Carnivores: eat Consumers (e.g. lions, tigers, cats)
- Omnivores: eat both Consumers and Producers (e.g. human beings, dogs)  
  
#### Decomposers
Decomposers eat and break down waste products and remains of dead organisms. These broken down components go to the soil and are used up by plants.  
Most __fungi__ and __bacteria__ fall into this category.
