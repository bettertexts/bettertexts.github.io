## Introduction  
This chapter will take a look at India from the 1920s and ahead, with emphasis on the Non-Cooperation and Civil Disobedience movements. 

- In India as well as many other ex-colonies, the growth of modern nationalism is intimately connected with the anti-colonial movement. 
- Oppression under colonialism forged a shared bond that tied many different groups together. 
- Even then, each class and group felt the effects of colonialism differently, therefore their notions of freedom were not the same.
- The Congress under Mahatma Gandhi tried to forge these groups together, but this unity did not emerge without conflict. 

## 1. The First World War, Khilafat, and Non-Cooperation  
- World War 1 created a new economical and political situation, including:
    + A huge increase in defence expenditure, which was financed by war loans and increased taxation.
    + Prices increased, doubling between 1913 and 1918, which led to extreme economic hardship for the common people.
    + Villages were called upon for forced military recruitment, which caused widespread anger.
- To add to the fun, crops failed in many parts of India between the years 1918-19 and 1920-21, which caused an acute food shortage.  
- Ofcourse there was an epidemic too. Influenza, in this case. As per the 1921 census, 12-13 million people perished in that epidemic.
- People hoped that the hardships would end once the war was over. But it didn't.  

- At just the right time, a new leader appeared, and suggested a new mode of struggle.

### 1.1 The idea of _Satyagraha_
- Mahatma Gandhi successfully fought the racist regime in South Africa with his new method of peaceful protest called _Satyagraha_.
- _Satyagraha_ emphasised the power of truth and the need to search for truth.
- _Satyagraha_ suggested that if the cause for struggle is against injustice, then there is no need for physical brute force.
- Gandhi believed that opressors should be persuaded to see the truth, rather than being violently forced to accept the truth.

- After arriving in India, Mahatma Gandhi organised various _satyagraha_ movements, including:
    + __Champaran, Bihar (1917):__ peasants struggle against the plantation system.
    + __Kheda, Gujarat (1917/18):__ relaxation of tax collection, as the peasants of Kheda were affected by crop failures and a plague epidemic.
    + __Ahemedabad, Gujarat (1918):__ for a wage raise of cotton mill workers.

### 1.2 The Rowlatt Act
| The Rowlatt Act of 1919 |
| ----------------------- |
| The Rowlatt Act gave the government enormous powers to repress political activities, and allowed upto two years of detention for political prisoners without even a trial |

Mahatma Gandhi wanted a non-violent civil disobedience against such unjust laws, which would start with a _hartal_ on 6 April 1919.    
  
Rallies were organised, workers went on strikes, and shops closed down.  
Alarmed by this and scared that communication lines, like railways and telegrams will be disrupted, the British administration decided to stop the nationalists.  
  
Local leaders were picked up from Amritsar, and Mahatma Gandhi was barred from entering Delhi.  

#### 1.2.1 The Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre
- On 10 April, the police in Amritsar fired upon a peaceful procession, which provoked widespread attacks on banks, post offices and railway stations.  
- As the situation got out of control, direct military control was imposed and General Dyer took command.  
- On 13 April 1919, the infamous Jallianwalla Bagh massacre took place.
    + A large crowd had gathered in the enclosed ground of Jallianwalla Bagh.
    + Some people came to protest, while others had come to attend the annual Baisakhi fair.
    + Many villagers were unaware of the martial law that had been imposed.
    + General Dyer entered the area, blocked the exits, and opened fire on the crowd, killing hundreds,
    + In a later statement, he said that his object was "to produce a moral effect", and to terrify the _satyagrahis_.

#### 1.2.2 Aftermath of the Massacre
- Crowds took to the streets in many North Indian towns as the news of the massacre spread.  
- There were strikes, clashes with the police and attacks on government buildings.
- The government responded with brutality, trying to terrorise and humiliate the people.
- _Satyagrahis_ were forced to rub their noses on the ground and crawl on the streets.
- People were flogged.
- Villages (around what is Pakistan today) were bombed.  
  
Seeing all this violence and brutality, Gandhiji called off the  movement.
